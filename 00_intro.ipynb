    "\n",
    "##### Question 06\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Question 14\n",
    "Why have two seperate functions for setting the background? Create a scenario in which that would be useful.\n",
    "- **Answer:** Having two separate functions for setting the background is useful when you want to create contrast between the plot area and the surrounding figure area. For example, you might want a white plot area for clarity, but a colored background for the overall figure to make it stand out on a page or presentation slide."

    "About how many students are in the tallest group?\n",
    "- **Answer:** About 6-7 students are in the tallest group.\n",

    "##### Question 25\n",
    "What does the `bins=6` argument do in the `plt.hist()` function? Try changing the value to see what happens\n",
    "- **Answer:** The `bins=6` argument in the `plt.hist()` function determines the number of bars (or bins) in the histogram. Changing this value will adjust how the data is grouped and displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 26\n",
    "Why would you want different amount of bins in a histogram chart?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Different numbers of bins in a histogram can be useful for revealing different patterns in the data. Fewer bins can show broad trends, while more bins can reveal finer details in the distribution."
