    "What is Pandas, and what are its primary functions in data visualization for data science?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. Its primary functions in data visualization include data cleaning, transformation, merging, and providing data structures optimized for efficient operations on tabular and time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does \"data manipulation\" mean in the context of pandas and data science field?\n",
    "- **Answer:**  In the context of pandas and data science, \"data manipulation\" refers to the process of transforming and reorganizing data to make it more suitable for analysis. This includes tasks like filtering, sorting, aggregating, and reshaping data to extract meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "What kind of files can pandas read? List at least 3:\n",
    "- **Answer:** Pandas can read various file formats, including CSV, Excel (XLS, XLSX), JSON, SQL databases, and HDF5. It also supports reading from HTML tables and clipboard data."

    "##### Question 07\n",
    "What data type is the 'Date' column? Is this what you expected? \n",

    "\n",
    "##### Question 08\n",
    "Why might pandas choose different data types for different columns?\n",
